# Route Handlers

The route handlers included in `@nextwp/core` add endpoints in your Next.js project's app router to handle things like preview and revalidation. <br/> {{ className: "lead" }}

These route handlers are included by default in the starter project generated with [create-nextwp-app](/packages/create-nextwp-app). {{ className: "lead" }}

## revalidate

The revalidate route handler in Next.js allows for instant content updates without triggering a full site build. When a post is updated in WordPress, the specific page(s) in Next.js are regenerated, ensuring that the latest content is displayed.

To use the revalidate route handler, you need to install the [On-Demand Revalidation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/on-demand-revalidation/) WordPress plugin.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/revalidate/route.ts" }}
export { revalidate as PUT } from '@nextwp/core'
```

## preview

<Note>
  @todo: rename NextWordPressPreview to "preview" in the codebase, add
  deprecation warning for old import
</Note>

The `preview` route handler is used to preview posts in WordPress.

You can use preview with default settings by simply re-exporting the handler.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/draft/[...preview]/route.ts" }}
export { preview as GET } from '@nextwp/core'
```

Or you can customize the preview handler by passing options to the `preview` function.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/draft/[...preview]/route.ts" }}
import { preview } from '@nextwp/core'

const previewOptions = {
  toolbar: true, // Shows the preview toolbar on the left side of the screen
}

const previewHandler = preview(previewOptions)

export { previewHandler as GET }
```
