# Route Handlers

<Note>
  @todo: update/rewrite this section to be more clear with good usage examples
</Note>

The route handlers included in `@nextwp/core` add endpoints in your Next.js project's app router to handle things like preview and revalidation. <br/> {{ className: "lead" }}

These route handlers are included by default in the starter project generated with [create-nextwp-app](/packages/create-nextwp-app). {{ className: "lead" }}

## nextwpRouteHandler

<Note>
  This is a planned feature and is not yet implemented. The naming and API is
  subject to change. We are currently iterating on this feature and it should be
  released in the next minor version of `@nextwp/core`.
</Note>

A single unified route handler that can be used for all NextWP integrations with WordPress such as preview and revalidation. It handles all requests to the `/api/wp/[...nextwp]/route.ts` route.

The individual route handlers can still be used instead, but this unified route handler is recommended for most use cases.

### Usage example

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/wp/[...nextwp]/route.ts" }}
import { nextwpRouteHandler } from '@nextwp/core'

const handler = nextwpRouteHandler({
  preview: {
    // Hides the preview toolbar that appears in draft mode on the left side of the screen
    toolbar: false,
  },
  revalidate: {
    // revalidate options
  },
})

export { handler as GET, handler as PUT }
```

## revalidate

<Note>
  The revalidate route handler directory location is subject to change with the
  release of the unified route handler.
</Note>

The revalidate route handler in Next.js allows for instant content updates without triggering a full site build. When a post is updated in WordPress, the specific page(s) in Next.js are regenerated, ensuring that the latest content is displayed.

To use the revalidate route handler, you need to install the [On-Demand Revalidation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/on-demand-revalidation/) WordPress plugin.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/revalidate/route.ts" }}
export { revalidate as PUT } from '@nextwp/core'
```

## preview

<Note>
  The preview route handler directory location is subject to change with the
  release of the unified route handler.
</Note>

The `preview` route handler is used to preview posts in WordPress.

You can use preview with default settings by simply re-exporting the handler.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/draft/[...preview]/route.ts" }}
export { preview as GET } from '@nextwp/core'
```

Or you can customize the preview handler by passing options to the `preview` function.

```ts {{ title: "src/app/api/draft/[...preview]/route.ts" }}
import { preview } from '@nextwp/core'

const previewOptions = {
  toolbar: true, // Shows the preview toolbar on the left side of the screen
}

const previewHandler = preview(previewOptions)

export { previewHandler as GET }
```
