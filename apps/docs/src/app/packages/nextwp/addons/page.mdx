## PreloadResources

`PreloadResources` is a critical tool in optimizing your Next.js application, particularly for preloading various media types in the page head. It functions similarly to the priority prop in Next Image, which you can read about in more detail [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#priority).

### Purpose and Use

While the priority prop in Next Image is ideal for optimizing the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) elements (typically large images or text blocks), `PreloadResources` extends this optimization strategy to other key media types like videos. Itâ€™s important to note that for images, you should still use Next Image with the priority prop, and for fonts, consider using `next/font`, as detailed in the Next.js docs [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts).

### Usage Scenario

This component is especially useful for media elements like videos that are critical to your initial viewport but are not images. It ensures these elements are loaded efficiently, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and potentially improving LCP.

### Usage Example

Optimizing your Next.js application's performance is crucial, and PreloadResources plays a key role in this process. This React component allows you to preload various types of media resources in the head of your page, similar to how the [priority prop in Next Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#priority) optimizes image loading.

### What it does

PreloadResources enhances the loading performance of non-image media types like videos and fonts. While Next Image's priority prop is specifically designed for optimizing LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) elements, which are usually large images or text blocks, PreloadResources extends this concept to other media types. This ensures that your application's critical media assets are loaded promptly, contributing positively to your page's LCP and overall user experience.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Preloading**: Strategically load resources in the page's head to minimize loading times.
- **Media-Ready**: Ideal for optimizing video display, reducing the initial load impact on user experience.
- **Flexible Resource Management**: Easily manage a variety of resource types including video, images, and fonts.

### Usage

```jsx
import { PreloadResources } from '@nextwp/addons'

export function PageTemplate() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PreloadResources
        resources={[
          {
            as: 'video',
            href: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
          },
        ]}
      />

      {/* ... use the preloaded asset */}
      <video autoPlay loop>
        <source src="https://example.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
  )
}
```
