## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, you will need a WordPress site. You can use any host for this but I recommend [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/?utm_source=nextwp&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=nextwp-docs) as they have a great developer experience and reliable hosting. {{ className: 'lead' }} <br/>

Some features like preview and revalidation require the [NextWP Toolkit](/packages/wordpress/nextwp-toolkit-plugin) plugin installed in WordPress. {{ className: 'lead' }} <br/>

The easiest way to prepare your WordPress site for NextWP is to install the [NextWP Headless Theme](/packages/wordpress/nextwp-headless-theme)
to automatically install the recommended plugins.
