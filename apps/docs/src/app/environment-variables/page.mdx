# Environment Variables

NextWP requires environment variables to be set in order to connect to WordPress.
These variables can be added to a `.env.local` file located in the root directory of your project, or added in your hosting provider's environment variables section.

NextWP requires an application password to be set in order to request certain data from WordPress such as the site settings, options pages, post type labels, and more.

You can generate an application password in WordPress admin dashboard under Users > Your Profile > Application Passwords.

Make sure to set the preview secret, and revalidate secret to the matching values in the NextWP Toolkit plugin settings in WordPress.

You can quickly copy these randomly generated secrets to your `.env.local` for your convenience.
