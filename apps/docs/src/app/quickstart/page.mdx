# Quickstart

This quickstart guide will get you all set up and ready to build your headless WordPress site with NextWP. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## WordPress hosting

If you don't have a WordPress site yet, you can create one using any hosting provider like [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/?utm_source=nextwp&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=nextwp-docs), [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8c72c601817b), or [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/?kaid=ZWZKLOAMLNDP)
We recommend [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/?utm_source=nextwp&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=nextwp-docs) as they have a great developer experience and reliable hosting.

## Pre-requisites

NextWP connects with the NextWP Toolkit plugin in your WordPress site for certain features such as the preview mode, and fetching additional data from WordPress that is not included by default in the WP REST API such as the site settings, ACF options pages, post type labels, and more.

To connect your WordPress site to your Next.js project, you will need to install the [NextWP Toolkit](/packages/wordpress/nextwp-toolkit-plugin) plugin on your WordPress site.

## Create a new project

To create a new NextWP project, you can use the `create-nextwp-app` CLI tool to generate a starter project. This tool will automatically set up a new project for you, including all the necessary dependencies and configuration files to get you started with NextWP.

<Note>
  The NextWP CLI tool is currently very new and experimental. If you run into
  any issues, please let us know.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npx create-nextwp-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpx create-nextwp-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn create nextwp-app
```

</CodeGroup>

## Installation

If you already have a Next.js project, you can install `@nextwp/core` and optionally `@nextwp/addons` using your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm install @nextwp/core
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @nextwp/core
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @nextwp/core
```

</CodeGroup>

## Add Environment Variables

NextWP requires environment variables to be set in order to connect to WordPress.
These variables can be added to a `.env.local` file located in the root directory of your project, or added in your hosting provider's environment variables section.

NextWP requires an application password to be set in order to request certain data from WordPress such as the site settings, options pages, post type labels, and more.

You can generate an application password in WordPress admin dashboard under Users > Your Profile > Application Passwords.

Make sure to set the preview secret, and revalidate secret to the matching values in the NextWP Toolkit plugin settings in WordPress.

You can quickly copy these randomly generated secrets to your `.env.local` for your convenience.
