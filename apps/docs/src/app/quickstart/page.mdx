# Quickstart

If you don't have a WordPress site yet, you can create one using any hosting provider. {{ className: 'lead' }} <br/>
We recommend [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/?utm_source=nextwp&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=nextwp-docs) as they have a great developer experience and reliable hosting. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Setup WordPress

NextWP requires the [NextWP Toolkit](/packages/wordpress/nextwp-toolkit-plugin) plugin to be installed on your WordPress site in order to support some features like [preview](/packages/nextwp/core/route-handlers#next-word-press-preview).

## Create a new project

To create a new NextWP project, you can use the `create-nextwp-app` CLI tool to generate a starter project. This tool will automatically set up a new project for you, including all the necessary dependencies and configuration files to get you started with NextWP.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpx create-nextwp-app my-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn create nextwp-app my-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npx create-nextwp-app my-app
```

</CodeGroup>
<Note>
  The NextWP CLI tool is currently very new and experimental. If you run into any issues, please let us know.
</Note>

## Installation

If you already have a Next.js project, you can install `@nextwp/core` and `@nextwp/addons` using your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @nextwp/core @nextwp/addons
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @nextwp/core @nextwp/addons
```

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm install @nextwp/core
```

</CodeGroup>

## Add Environment Variables

NextWP requires environment variables to be set in order to connect to WordPress.
These variables can be added to a `.env.local` file located in the root directory of your project.

You can quickly copy these randomly generated variables to your `.env.local`

<EnvCodeBlock />

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/environment-variables" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs for environment variables</>
  </Button>
</div>
