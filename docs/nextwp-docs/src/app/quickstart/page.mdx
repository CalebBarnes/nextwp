# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use NextWP. We'll cover how to get started with a new project, how to install NextWP in an existing project, and how to set up your environment variables.

## Create a new project

To create a new NextWP project, you can use the `create-nextwp-app` CLI tool to generate a starter project. This tool will automatically set up a new project for you, including all the necessary dependencies and configuration files to get you started with NextWP.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpx create-nextwp-app my-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn create nextwp-app my-app
```

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npx create-nextwp-app my-app
```

</CodeGroup>
<Note>
  The NextWP CLI tool is currently very new and experimental. If you run into any issues, please let us know.
</Note>

## Installation

To install @nextwp/core in your Next.js project, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @nextwp/core
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @nextwp/core
```

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm install @nextwp/core
```

</CodeGroup>

## Add Environment Variables

NextWP requires certain environment variables to be set in order to connect to WordPress.
These variables can be added to a `.env.local` file located in the root directory of your project. The following variables are mandatory:

<Row>
  <Col>
    <Properties>
      <Property name="NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_URL" type="string">
        The URL of your WordPress site. <br />
        Example: `https://example-wordpress.com`
      </Property>
      {/* <Property name="NEXT_SITE_URL" type="string">
        The URL of your Next.js site. <br/>
        Example: `https://example-frontend.com`
      </Property> */}
      <Property name="WP_APPLICATION_PASSWORD" type="string">
        The application password used to authenticate with WordPress.
      </Property>
      <Property name="NEXT_PREVIEW_SECRET" type="string">
        The secret used to authenticate WordPress page previews. <br />
        Previews require the NextWP Toolkit Plugin installed in WordPress.
      </Property>
      <Property name="REVALIDATE_SECRET_KEY" type="string">
        A secret key used to revalidate pages.
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Col>

<Col>

You can add these variables to your `.env.local` file like so:

```bash {{ title: '.env.local' }}
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_URL=
WP_APPLICATION_PASSWORD=
NEXT_PREVIEW_SECRET=
REVALIDATE_SECRET_KEY=
```

</Col>
</Row>

<div className="not-prose">

    <>Read the docs for environment variables</>
  </Button>
</div>
